# Product Importance Analysis using Unsupervised Learning

This project focuses on the application of unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and determine the importance of products for a fictional logistics company. The goal is to uncover insights about product importance without relying on labeled data, using clustering and decision tree methods.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze data from a fictional logistics company to determine the importance of various products in their portfolio. By applying unsupervised learning methods, such as K-Means clustering and Decision Trees, we aim to segment the products and derive metrics that indicate their significance to the company.

### Methodology
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The project begins with loading and cleaning the dataset, ensuring that the data is ready for analysis. The data contains various attributes of the products that are relevant to the logistics operations.

2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - K-Means clustering is applied to segment the products into distinct groups based on their attributes. This unsupervised method helps in identifying patterns and groupings within the data that are not immediately obvious.

3. **Decision Tree Analysis**:
   - After clustering, a Decision Tree is used to analyze the clusters and extract rules that help in understanding what makes certain products more important than others. This step involves interpreting the tree to determine which product features contribute most to the segmentation.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - The results from the clustering and decision tree analysis are interpreted to provide actionable insights. These insights can help the logistics company prioritize products based on their importance, optimize inventory management, and improve overall logistics efficiency.
