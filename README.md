# LukasKnill-MachineLearning-Portfolion

This repository provides an insight into some of the machine learning projects I have worked on, sharing a piece of my work and my exploration in the field of machine learning.

## Branches Overview

### 1. **SoilQuality-ImageSegmentation**
   - **Purpose**: This branch contains a real-world project focused on assessing soil quality through image segmentation. The project involves using AI-driven segmentation to analyze soil images captured by a tractor, determining soil quality metrics that can optimize agricultural machinery settings. Note that only parts of this project have been uploaded to provide a brief insight into the work.

### 2. **DeepLearning**
   - **Purpose**: This branch showcases various deep learning projects that I have worked on. These projects cover different aspects of deep learning, such as self-supervised learning, object detection, image segmentation, and explainable 
### 3. **UnsupervisedLearning**
   - **Purpose**: This branch contains projects focused on unsupervised learning methods. Specifically, it includes the application of K-Means clustering and decision trees to analyze product importance for a fictional logistics company
